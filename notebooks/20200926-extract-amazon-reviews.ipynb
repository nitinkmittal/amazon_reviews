We've had a strange winter so far here in Northern Oklahoma, some nights are very cold and others are warm. With normal blankets I'd be adding them one night and taking them off the next to stay comfortable. I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that this comforter by itself, kept me warm and cozy on the cold nights and kept me cool on the warm nights! I love this comforter so much that will buy more of these for my home and I plan on giving these blankets as Gifts. I can't believe how inexpensive they are, how high the quality of craftsmanship and how marvelous it feels to sleep under this extremely delightful comforter. If you want to sleep deep and awaken refreshed... get this comforter!\",\n",

I bought this comforter on sale when it was Amazon Prime day and also because I needed a new comforter, as my dog had accidentally clawed through my other one. It had only been about $30-$40 at the time so I figured why not. I also got it in the Queen Plus size for a very good reason... because not only does my boyfriend steal covers, but so does the dog. I FINALLY GET SOME BLANKET AT NIGHT. Not only that, but the dog has yet to claw through it (she's Pitbull/Greyhound mix and her claws get SHARP... my fault). It's super soft and comfortable, durable, and washes great (pet hair! UGH!). My boyfriend loves it too. We'll definitely be getting more in other colors soon (we have the Gray/Charcoal one now). I'm eyeing that Gray/Navy one. Wishing it came in a few more colors, like a Pale Blue and Gray or Purple and Gray. That's about the only downside of this product is the lack of color pallet. But honestly... not a big deal AT ALL. Love love love. Love. Love.\",\n",

I needed down alternative and this is quilted so the stuffing doesn\\'t shift. I wanted to feel like I\\'m sleeping in a light, fluffy, marshmallow and this delivers. The material is soft and the colors are pretty, but I bought a duvet cover to keep it nice longer. The XL is REALLY long which I like, but check the length if you\\'re looking at covers.
